# BayesianStatistics

This repositiory is my work space for practicing Bayesian statistics. I will be following the book ' Doing Bayesian Statistics'
by Kruschke which is an amazing book to read from. I will do the implementation of the Bayesian Analysis in Python. In order to use the python codes I will also consult another book ' Bayesian Statistics for Hackers' by Cameron Davidson-Pilon.
